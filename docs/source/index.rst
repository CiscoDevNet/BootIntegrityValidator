Certain Cisco products include a feature called Boot Integrity Visability.  The feature is designed to allow
an administrator take some internal state measurements from the operating system of the device.  These samples
can then be compared against "known good values" (KGVs) provided by Cisco.  This can confirm if the device is
running unaltered software and provide a validation of the integrity of the operating system.
